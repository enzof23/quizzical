- Create state to store input data
    {
        category: default,
        amount: default,
        difficulty: default,
    }

- MUST ADD &type=multiple at the end of every url, otherwise will respond with true/false type questions and data received won't be parsed properly

- Default url (everything set to default) : https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple => "10 questions, any category, any difficulty"

- Set amount with amount=NUMBER
    - should limit to 5/10/20


- Each category has a different code :
    General knowledge: 9 (https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=9)
    Books : 10
    Movies: 11
    Music: 12
    TV: 14
    Video games: 15
    Science & nature: 17
    Sport: 21
    Geography: 22
    History: 23
    Art: 25

- Set difficulty with &=DIFFICULTY
    - easy
    - medium
    - hard

AMOUNT comes first, CATEGORY second, DIFFICULTY third, &type=multiple last
eg : https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=5&category=21&difficulty=medium&type=multiple
       5 questions, category 21 = sport, difficulty medium, multiple answers 


- Create state to toggle between components :
        - const [input, setInput] = useState("category") (by default so category is the first page shown)

- Create component for each input :
    - Component category
        - find style to display category selection (checkbox, buttons/boxes, scroll list, vertical nav style)
        - "random" category selected by default which returns "default"
        - button to submit selection :
            - on submit, edit input data state to {...state, category: "category selected/category code"}
            - on submit, edit input state to "amount-difficulty" => this will display difficulty & amount component
    - Component difficulty & amount
        - same fonctionnement as category component
            - submit button edit input data state to {...state, amount: "amount selected", difficulty:"difficulty selected"}
            - submit button updates input state to "start-page"

    - Update Start component
        - display "Your Quiz is ready" with "Start Quiz" button, same functionnality as before (newGame state toggle)
        - fetch the API when input state is on "start-page" ?
            - URL = https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount={input.amount}&category={input.category}&=difficulty={input.difficulty}&type=multiple

   

button for each category, each button has function on click :
    onClick(category)

    <button onClick=(category.value)>
